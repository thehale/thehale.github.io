## Introduction

You made it! Most people do not bother reading privacy policies, so I am glad
you are taking the time to do so. I will attempt to make it as straightforward
of an experience as possible for the both of us.

I am a professional software developer. I build lots of projects that people use
and love, many of them [open-source](https://github.com/thehale). I also care
deeply about digital privacy; I reject the idea that software must have access
to invasive amounts of data to function properly.

That said, some of my projects have the ability to collect data about the people
using them. I always keep this data collection to a minimum, and, where
possible, I make it an "opt-in" process.

I only ever use the data I collect to help guide decisions around how to improve
my software projects. I never have sold user data and I never will. That said, I
will make efforts to monetize some of my projects so that I can continue
improving them. As such, I may integrate some third-party services into my
projects that are not so noble in their use of your data (e.g. Google Analytics,
Google AdSense, Facebook Ads, etc.).

I share these guiding principles first because they will remain consistent even
while this privacy policy adapts to rapidly changing privacy laws and my
understanding of them.

If you have any questions about any of these principles, or any part of my
privacy policy, you can email them to me at
[legal@jhale.dev](mailto:legal@jhale.dev).
