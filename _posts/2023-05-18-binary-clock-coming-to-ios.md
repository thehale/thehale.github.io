Your nerdy timepiece will soon be available on the Apple App Store!

To date, my Binary Clock application has [only been offered on the Google Play
Store](https://jhale.dev/projects/2022/07/02/introducing-binary-clock.html#where-can-i-get-it).
Thanks to a recent grant I am now able to offer the app on the Apple App Store!
(More details to come soon...)

When the app goes live I will look forward to your feedback! The best place to
discuss issues or request features is on the project's public [GitHub Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/thehale/BinaryClock/issues). You can also send
private messages to [support@jhale.dev](mailto:support@jhale.dev).
