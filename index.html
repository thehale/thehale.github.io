<h1 class="post-title">Hello! 👋🏻</h1>

<p>I am a bilingual (Spanish/English) software engineering masters student with two
and a half years of experience in deploying financial ETL microservices and
creating/contributing to open source projects.</p>

<p>Currently I'm best with Python and Java, but I'm quickly coming up to speed with
JavaScript while I work on learning React Native so I can build educational
web/mobile applications for the benefit of everyday people.</p>

<p>During my free time I love solving Rubik's Cubes (averaging under 15
seconds), playing music (piano, viola, singing bass), chasing down a Frisbee in
a competitive game with friends, and trying out my hand at graphic design
(specifically logo design).</p>
